I am a current master's student in Data Science from Tufts University. I have spent most of my time in data processing, machine learning, and database. I have worked extensively with different machine learning techniques to infer insights and forecast the future. In addition, I have performed various data visualization for better result presentation.

My path in data science
======
During my study in Data Science, I have acquired good understanding of algorithms, have been workding on machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, big dat, visual analytics etc. I can flexibly apply lots of packages from Python, such as NumPy, pandas, sklearn, cv2, and perform many data modeling tasks or search tasks from script, such as implementation of decision tree, neural network, recursive Bayesian model. I am also familiar with many database languages, such as SQL and NoSQL. In addition, I also have experience in big data analysis using big query and dataproc from the google cloud platform. Relevant course projects include: topic modeling of large data using GCP, sentiment analysis and digit recongnition, establishment of deep neural network, full-stack visual analytics systems.

Food science
------
I also got a Ph.D degree in food science from University of Massachusetts Amherst. I have done research in several distinctive areas and have had a broad span of knowledge and research experience, including plant-based foods, protein-stabilized emulsions, protein hydrolysis, release and absorption of nuetraceuticals, preparation and application of novel electrode component. Till now, I have published over 14 peer-reviewed papers as first author (three review paper, highest impact factor of 14.71) and 25 papers as coauthor. I have 955 citations and 19 h-index (google scholar). 
<br />
My Ph.D. study has taught me a lot of experimental and soft skills in order to be an excellent researcher in other disciplines. I have developed skills in experimental design and execution, teamwork, critical thinking, problem-solving and time management. I have worked on various projects and published tens of scientific papers. Besides, I have clear and concise communication skills, such as to deliver academic oral presentations.
