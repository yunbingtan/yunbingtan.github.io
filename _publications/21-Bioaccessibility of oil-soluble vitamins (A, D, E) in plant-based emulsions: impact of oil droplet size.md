This research article systematically investigated the impact of oil droplet diameter (0.15, 1.6, and 11 um) on the bioaccessibility of three oil-soluble vitamins (vitamin A palmitate, vitamin D, and vitamin E acetate) encapsulated within soybean oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by quillaja saponin.
